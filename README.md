# Rights-Of-Passage
The next twenty years will be very critical for the nation and the African
continent on every front of development. We are confronted by a fast
paced, out of control environment of business disruption driven by
technology and lifestyle changes.
How do young people in Nigeria cope with the spate of disruption within
an environment fraught with uncertainty, lack of opportunities and
despair? Many youths make career choices based entirely on inadequate
information or second guesses on how the economy works. Others mindlessly
plunge into the rat race labyrinth for survival and wound up frustrated with the
quality of lives they lead.
In the absence of safety nets that provide immediate support for young people who have been cultured
and socialized in such depressed economies and challenging environments, these youths are at risk of
shrinking their perspectives to accommodate their realities and thus compromise their true capacity to
astound the world.
The good news is that preparing for the future doesn't have to be rigorously grueling.
Nor is it rocket science. A simple evidence based system that allows young people to
mind map the future and deliberately build skills that empower them to dominate
high skills and high wage global industries of the future is what the RITE OF
PASSAGE is about.
The Agenda2040's Rites of Passage programme confronts this reality through a
multi-layered approach that presents Nigerian teenagers a clear and sure path to
adulthood and industry readiness.
